<h1>FAQ for the RSPerl package</h1>

  <p class="date">July 6, 06</p>
  <li>When running Perl inside R, I create a new Perl interpreter
      via .PerlInit() and later I close it via .PerlTerminate().
      However, I get a lot of messages of the form      
<pre>
Attempt to free non-existent shared string 'ldlibpthname' during global destruction.
</pre>
  What's the problem?
  <dd class="answer">
     I have two versions of Perl installed on one of my machines.
     These are 5.8.0 and 5.8.8 in /usr and /usr/local.
     When I use the 5.8.8 version, I get these error messages.
     When I use 5.8.0, everything is fine.
     <p/>
      I haven't yet had the time to determine what the underlying
      cause of the problem is. Thread is one possibility.
      Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be a problem as we can continue
      the R session and we can also subsequently  create new Perl
      interpreters that work.

  
  <dt class="question">
  <p class="date">July 5, 06</p>
  <li>When running Perl inside R, I try to load a module via
      .PerlPackage("myPackage")  or .PerlExpr("use myPackage;").
      But I get an error something like
<pre>
Error in .PerlExpr("use GCC::TranslationUnit;") : 
	Error evaluating use GCC::TranslationUnit;: Can't load '/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Fcntl/Fcntl.so' for module Fcntl: /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Fcntl/Fcntl.so: undefined symbol: PL_sv_undef at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i686-linux/XSLoader.pm line 70.
 at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i686-linux/Fcntl.pm line 234
</pre>
      where Fcntl is replaced by the package you are trying to load.
      What's the problem? and how can I fix it?
  <dd class="answer">
  The problem relates to how Perl loads modules  with native
      code. When the modules are compiled and installed, it is
      expected that they will be used within the standalone Perl. All
      the Perl code (symbols such as PL_sv_undef) that these modules
      use is found when they are dynamically loaded into the running
      Perl application. When R is the host and Perl is embedded, these
      symbols are not in the host application, but kept in the separate
      table that is created when Perl is loaded.
      <p>
       How do you get around this? There are two ways:
      <ol>
	<li> When installing RSPerl, tell it which modules you will
	    want to load that have native code that will be dynamically
	    loaded. Do this with the --with-modules argument to
	    configre
	     (using the --configure-args option for R CMD INSTALL).
       <li> The other approach is to force the Perl symbols to be
	   available centrally via the host application. You can do this on
	   UNIX, at least, by loading the RSPerl.so into R with the
	   local argument set to FALSE, i.e.
<pre>
dyn.load(system.file("libs", paste("RSPerl", .Platform$dynlib.ext, sep = "")), package = "RSPerl") ,
          local  = FALSE)
</pre>	   
 Do this BEFORE you load the RSPerl package with library(RSPerl) or it
	   is implicitly loaded.
	   
      </ol>

  
  <dt class="question">
  <p class="date">Jun 7, 06</p>
  <li> When I install, I'd like to have the Perl module files (i.e
      R.pm and RReferences.pm and the documentation files) be installed in the usual places for
       Perl packages. How can I do this?
  <dd class="answer">
      The simplest answer is to use --with-perl-prefix
      when specifying the configuration arguments to R CMD INSTALL.
      Use
<pre>
  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-perl-prefix=' RSPerl
</pre>      
Note that there is no value given for the argument. This tells the
  configuration script that you want Perl's own setting.
(Alternatively you can specify a directory of your     own chosing
      and the files will be installed under that.

      <p/>
       That wasn't so hard now, was it?  Well the only problem is that
      when the configuration script asked Perl to install these files
      it probably failed as you did not have permission to write to
      those system-level  directories. (<i>You may have if you were
      running   as root, but that is far from ideal. Do you really trust this
      configuration script in all its complexity not to do something
      dangerous.   I know I don't and I wrote the script!</i>).
       <p/>
      To fix this problem, assuming you didn't use the --clean
      argument for R CMD INSTALL, we can do that part of the
      installation manually.
      Either use sudo or explicitly login as root to
      perform the following task:
      <ul>
	<li>  Change directory to <code>RSPerl/src</code>

	<li>  give the command<br>
               <code>make -f Makefile.perl install</code>
      </ul>

   There you go!

      <br>
   Thanks to Michael Dondrup for motivating me to do this.
      
      
  <dt class="question">
  <li> When running Perl within an R session, I am trying to load a
      Perl module.  However, I just get a segmentation fault and a crash.
  <dd class="answer">
      I'm trying to find a good way to prohibit this from happening
      and catch error messages about the reason for the failure.
      Before I get to that however, the following may be helpful.
      The issue is probably to do with dynamically loaded modules
      in Perl running inside R.
      The way Perl loads modules that themselves have compiled native
      code, e.g. C, C++ or Fortran,
      is a little akward and this manifests itself when Perl is
      embedded in another application.
      When compiling the embedded Perl, we must tell it what modules
      we expect to load that have native code.
      And we must also get the dependencies right.
      For example, I wanted to load the IO module.
      But that depends on the Fcntl and Socket modules which have
      native,
      compiled code.  So I need to tell the embedded Perl about those
      too when compiling it to go into R.
      To do this, use
<pre>
       R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-modules="IO Fcntl Socket"' RSPerl
</pre>      

       If you just specify IO and not the Fcntl and Socket, you'll see
      a segmentation fault after
<pre>
library(RSPerl)
.PerlExpr("use IO;")
</pre>

  When I try to install, the final link step
      in building RSPerl.so fails saying

ERROR: compilation failed for package `RSPerl'

      The simple perl script
<pre>

  <li> When calling R from Perl to draw a plot everything works fine
      when I call the script without any redirection. When I redirect
      a data stream into the script via a pipe or from a file such
      as
<pre>
   perl plot.pl < fileName
   bar | perl plot.pl
</pre>
   the plot does not appear!
      What's the problem?
  <dd class="answer">
      In fact the plot is created but it is not displayed in the
      usual window.  Instead, it is stored in the file <i>Rplot.ps</i> since the
      Postscript graphics device is the default when the R session
      is considered non-interactive. And it is considered
      non-interactive since the standard input stream is the redirected input.
      Essentially there is no terminal associated with the Perl
      process. This is an interaction between R and Perl when
      embedded and makes sense but may need to be overridable in the future.
      Connecting "connections" in Perl to R is also needed.
      <p>
      To fix this "problem", just explicitly open a graphics device
      before
      calling plot. See <i>plot1.pl</i> in the <b>tests</b> directory
      of the package.

  <dt class="question">
      When dealing with numbers in Perl and using them in R, I get
      errors   about the wrong mode, etc.
      What's the problem?

  <dd class="answer"> Perl tries to be helpful by working with strings and numbers
      alike without the user having to worry about the particular
      form. So <code>$a = "1"</code> can be used as a string or
      a number.
      However, when such a value is passed to R,  we pass it is
      a string to R. When used in an R expression that expects a
      number, R raises an error.
      <p>
    This arises when we use R to read numbers from a file or stream
    and then pass them directly to R. Instead, we must ensure that
    they are numbers in Perl before passing them to R.
    This can be done easily by merely adding <i>0</i> to the
    value as it is read.
    Or we can explicitly use R to convert the values to numbers
      (e.g. by calling <code>as.numeric</code>)
    and then use the result. This invilves multople transfers
      of the data.
    See <a href="examples/stringNums.pl">stringNums.pl</a>
      in the <b>tests/</b> directory.


  <dt class="question">
      I get errors saying <code>Non-code reference passed via .Perl.
      Need a sub-routine name or Code object.</code>
  <dd class="answer">
      More than likely, you are specifying both the name of
      a Perl routine and its package name, e.g.
<pre>
 .Perl("myRoutine",  pkg = "MyPackage")
</pre>      
      One thing to do is to load the
      Perl module/package (MyPackage) before using the
      call
<pre>
.PerlPackage("MyPackage")
</pre>
      Then the call
<pre>
 .Perl("myRoutine",  pkg = "MyPackage")
</pre>
      works fine.


  <p>
       Alternatively, we need to fix the code to identify the
      Code object that gets resolved.

   How do I find out where Perl is looking for modules.
  <dd class="answer">
      <pre>

       You may want to do this if you have two versions of perl
      installed and want to verify that it is using the right one.

      When I try to install the  RSPerl package, I get an error

  <dd class="answer">
    When Perl is run inside R, and one wants to load a
   Perl module which uses C code,  special handling is needed 
   which the RSPerl package tries to do automatically.
   To exclude some C-based modules from this treatment, 
   you can specify which ones to include, or none.

   <p>
   To run R inside Perl (only), you do not need
   this support for loading Perl modules.  Accordingly, the default
   for PERL_MODULES is no. So
<pre>    
   R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-in-perl' RSPerl
</pre>
    is the same as 
<pre>    
   R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-in-perl --with-modules=no' RSPerl
</pre>    

  <dt>
  <li> When running Perl from within R, I sometimes attempt load a
      Perl module and I get a horrific crash that terminates my R
      session.
      Can you help?
  <dd>
      This relates to <a href="#PerlModules">the question above</a>.
      If that module uses dynamically loaded C code in Perl, then you
      have to explicitly tell the RSPerl package to include it
      in the PERL_MODULES during the installation.
      <br>
      Of course, the R session shouldn't crash.
      This is related to the presence of threads in the Perl
      installation.
      One can determine all of the configuration settings used to
      build     the particular installation of Perl using
      <pre>perl -V</pre>
      and the command line arguments to Configure with
      <code>perl -V:config_args</code>

      If I build Perl with the command line
      <pre>
      ./Configure -de -Doptimize='-fPIC -g' ; make
      </pre>
      then the resulting version of Perl in /usr/local/bin
      behaves properly.
      Adding <code>-Dusemultiplicity</code> causes an error
      to terminate the process, e.g.
      .PerlPackage("Storable") just exits.

  <dt class="question">
  <p class="date">July 6, 06</p>
  <li> So you tell me I need to have specified the Perl modules that
      use compiled/native code when RSPerl is installed if I want to
      make use of them from within an R session. But how do I know
      which ones I need to specify.
  <dd>  Well one "brute force" way is on Linux is to use strace to
      find all relevant operations on a .so file. We can do this with
      the following  command where we load the Mail::Box::Mbox module
<pre>      
strace -f -F -s 300 perl -e 'use Mail::Box::Mbox;' |& grep '/.*\.so"'  | grep -v '\(No such file or directory\)' | grep -v CORE | sed -e 's|.*/auto/\(.*\)/.*\.so".*|\1|' | sort | uniq
</pre>
       All this does is run the Perl command to load the module and
      trace the system calls. We look only at the lines containing the
      string ".so" and exclude lines where the attempt to access the
      file was unsuccessful (i.e. there is a message "No such file or
      directory"). Then we exclude libperl.so itself which is in CORE
      and then get to work to extract the directory names after the
      /auto directory.  We can then process the list further to
      convert / to :: to get the Perl module name when they are nested.
