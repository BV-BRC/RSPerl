<h1>Changes for Versions of the RSPerl Package</h1>


<h2>0.92-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fixed compilation problem where the initRSession was not being
      activated in the compilation because the relevant configuration
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Added a call to croak() in the Perl code  initR to announce if the R in
       Perl is not supported.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.92-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Better support for determining location of R include files and
      libraries during installation .
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Handle long error messages in RS_PerlEvalString() routine "more gracefully".
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Removed dangling comma in creating a list (with a call to .PerlStashInfo) that suggested
       forthcoming argument and generated a warning when the package   was loaded.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> RReference objects now have an AUTOLOAD method which allows
      Perl users to make calls of the form
        $ref->method(1, 2, 3)
      which calls the R function method with $ref as the first
      argument  and 1, 2, 3 as the remaining arguments.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Added getPerlDynModules() to return the names of the Perl modules
       that can have C code that can be dynamically loaded into an R
       session when Perl is embedded in R. These are specified during
       the compilation of the package.
  <dd>      
</dl>


<h2>0.91-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Another bug when calling an anonymous R function from Perl passed as a
       reference to Perl. Identified by Hong Ni.
  <dd>  Reference counting problem on the result from Perl's getName()
       method for the RReference object.
       
</dl>

<h2>0.91-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Bug when calling an anonymous R function from Perl passed as a
       reference to Perl. Identified by Hong Ni.
  <dd>  RPerl_getReferenceName() left the Perl stack in an unusual
       state.  See Rclosure.pl for the example.
       
</dl>



<h2>0.91-0</h2>
<dl>
  
  <dt>
  <li>Fix supplied by Michael Dondrup for R_callWithNames in R.xs to

      avoid  a stack imbalance issue in R when dealing with R
       reference objects from Perl.
  <dd>


  <dt>
  <li> .PerlInit() now has an additional argument loadModules which
       can be used to load one or more Perl modules after the
       Perl interpreter has been initialized.
  <dd> You can avoid this by passing a value of FALSE.
     

  <dt>
  <li>.PerlPackage now
      <ul>
	<li> handles a vector of package names as the argument and
	    processes all of them one after another until one fails or
	    they all succeed;
	<li> returns a simple S3-style object of class PerlPackage
	    which contains the name of the package and a reference to
	    its stash from which one can access the different code objects;
	<li> avoids checking if the package exists first
              which was sometimes incorrect,
      </ul>

  <dt>
      
  <li>Added mkRef() function to create a Perl reference to a Perl object
       converted from an R value. This is for use in methods in which
       strict refs are in force, e.g. the NetAddr::IP::Find module.
      
  <dd>  See ipFind.R in tests/ for an example.
      
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> .PerlGetStash() function added for getting the stash from a
      reference to a code object, i.e. to get the containing module.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> perlModuleLoaded can determine whether a module has been loaded
       in this session. 
  <dd> (This may not guarantee that it is still loaded!)
       Unfortunately, it does not seem to provide any updated
       information after the first time it was called, so it would
       miss any modules that were loaded subsequent to the first call
      to perlModuleLoaded.

  <dt>
  <li> If a reference to a package is made in a call to .Perl,
       .PerlNew or .PerlStashInfo, it is automatically loaded, if possible. 
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> .PerlStashInfo() automatically uses .convert = FALSE for the
       top-level, main module to avoid cyclic references.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Perl's magic types are converted to R as a reference. It is
       important to preserve the "magic" semantics for general use.  Users can provide
       special converters in the appropriate contexts.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> .PerlExists() works again.
  <dd>
      
</dl>

<h2>0.9-0</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Added facility for specifying where the Perl module files
      should be installed via the
      <code>--with-perl-prefix=&lt;dir&gt;</code>
        and <code>--with-perl-lib=&lt;dir&gt;</code> configuration
      flags.  The values should give the name of the directory which
      is passed as the value of the PREFIX argument and LIB argument
      respectively to
      <code>perl Makefile.PL PREFIX= LIB=</code>.
      If you want to use the standard Perl location, then use
       <code> --with-perl-prefix=</code>, i.e. with no value specified
      for the directory and omit the --with-perl-lib.
       If you want specify the directory and use that one exactly as
      the value in PERL5LIB, then use --with-perl-lib.

      <p/>
      The default is still to install the Perl files into 
      <br>
      Note that the R installation process will attempt to perform the
      installation of the Perl module files. If it does not have
      permission to write to the relevant directories, it continues.
      You must then go to the RSPerl/src/ directory in the source
      package      and give the command
<pre>      
        make -f Makefile.perl install
</pre>
      having obtained the appropriate permissions, e.g., via sudo or
      logging in as root or whatever.
      
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> initR() in the Perl module now sets the value of R_HOME if it
      is not already set in the environment variables of the process
      and also loads the RSPerl package into R after starting the
      session.
      
  <dd>
       initR() is now a regular subroutine and
      initRSession() is the name of the native routine.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Set PERL5LIB in R function .PerlInit() if PERL5LIB and PERLIB
       are not already set in the process' environment variables.
  <dd> Function setPerlLib() is available to set this explicitly if
       you need it. And getPerl5LibValue() returns the value of the
       PERL5LIB setting determined at installation time.

  <dt>
  <li> Non-trivial update to the RFromPerl document (now in HTML from XML).
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Restored the old (0.8-0 and earlier) behaviour of converting
       references to Perl arrays and hashes as regular R vectors or lists.
  <dd> When conversion is not requested, e.g. with <code>convert =
       FALSE</code> in an R function call, the class of the resulting
       Perl reference is computed correctly.

  <dt>
  <li> When converting a Perl array (or hash) with a mixture of
       integers and reals (IV and NV in Perl types), the converter
       recognizes this and creates a numeric vector.
 <dd>  Added test for this scenario in isHomogeneous.
  
  <dt>
  <li> .PerlExpr() now does not terminate  via a call to exit
        when there is an error in the Perl command.
  <dd>
       This changes the third argument to Perl_eval_pv which is
      croak_on_error. A value of 0 avoids the error.
      We may use the approach of overriding CORE::exit as in mod_perl
      also.


  <dt>
  <li> The opaque data types that are used to represent references to
       Perl objects as regular R values now use external pointers in
      R.
       This will continue to undergoe change to clean this up and
      remove the R code that treats the object as a list. 
      
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Removed tryEval.c and all references to tryEval().
  <dd>


</dl>


<h2>0.8-2</h2>
 <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Modified tryEval.c to be a simple call to R_tryEval(). This avoids the problem of
      R_ToplevelExec not being an exported symbol unders some compilers.
  <dd>
 </dl>

<h2>0.8-1</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> names() for a PerlHashReference object now gives back the keys
      in the underlying Perl hash table.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> .PerlExpr() takes a convert argument which can be NULL to
       supress the return value.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Use [[ for accessing elements in a PerlHashReference or
      PerlArrayReference,    rather than the [ operator.
  <dd> The latter will be modified in subesquent releases to have
      different semantics.

  <dt>
  <li> Added convert argument for [[ operator for arrays and hash tables.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Caught a general case where the class of the Perl reference was not
       being computed correctly.
  <dd>
      
</dl>


<h2>0.8-0</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> The PERL5LIB needed to find the R.pm and RReferences.pm modules
      is now simpler: a single element <code>&lt;r package install dir&gt;share/lib/perl5/site_perl/</code>.
  <dt> You can still use the shell scripts in scripts/RSPerl.* to set
      the relevant variables.
  
  <dt>
  <li> If --with-in-perl is specified in the configure-args for the
       <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> command,  by default, support for Perl modules
        with C code are not compiled into the R interface. This is
        typically not a problem as people usually just call R from Perl.
        If you need bi-directional interaction, e.g. with callbacks,
        that require
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Patch from Stefan Evert for OS X so that we the Perl module can
       locate the libPerlConverter.dylib file without needing to
       explicitly set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to find libPerlConverter.*
  <dd> You can still use the shell scripts in scripts/RSPerl.* to set
      the relevant variables.
  
  <dt>
  <li> Fixed trivial but significant error in converting homogeneous
      arrays with references.
       
  <dd>  Identified by Jan Hummel. See nestedArrays.pl in the examples/
       directory.
  <dt>
  <li> Added facilities to specify a converter pair (predicate and
      converter routines) from Perl to convert from Perl  to R.
      
  <dd> Previously, this was feasible but not implemented.
</dl>

<h2>0.7-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Added an AUTOLOAD routine for R in Perl.
  <dd>  This allows users to call R functions using the syntax
   <code>R::sum(</code>, <code>R::plot()</code>,  etc.
       rather than  <code>R::call("sum")</code>.
       <br>
        This does not work for callWithNames(), at this point.
</dl>

<h2>0.6-5</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Fix to the regular expression in the NAMESPACE file.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.6-4</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> Altered the exportPattern() to explicilty export the functions
    we want.
    
  <dd>
  
  <dt>  Support for Mac OS X  for running R within Perl.
  <dd>  
  <ul> 
    <li> Create libPerlConverter as a dylib, and the others as bundles.

    <li> Use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in the RSperl.{csh,bsh} scripts to
       set the environment variables appropriately.
   
  </ul>

  <dt> Location of libR.so now points to lib in Makefile.PL.
  <dd>


  <dt> .onLoad() initializes the Perl interpreter.
  <dd> (Not certain this is a good idea, but it is backward compatible
        with earlier versions.)
      

  <dt> An undef in Perl was being returned as a reference to a strange
      object. Fixed now.
  <dd>

  <dt> Collapsing Perl arrays into vectors when possible
      (i.e. homogeneous types) in returning a value from Perl
      in .Perl() is now working better.
  <dd>

  <dt> .PerlFile now checks for the existence of the file and
      expands the path name, so ~ is expanded.
  <dd>

  <dt> Test that the Perl interpreter has been started before
      evaluating a Perl expression, etc. that uses it. This avoids
      silly segfaults.
  <dd>

  <dt> RPerlDebug in R.xs is now set to off.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.6-3</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
      Handle undefined values in callWithNames 
  <dd> Reported by Michael Dondrup with the example
         <code>R::callWithNames(foo, {'x'=>undef});</code>
</dl>



<h2>0.6-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> PDF now not empty files.
  <dd>
</dl>



<h2>0.6-1</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Patch from Eric Jensen (Information Retrieval Lab at Illinois
        Institute of Technology) for testing homegeneity of a Perl
        collection.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Fixed R::callWithNames() thanks to a bug report
      from Eric!
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Cleanup for R CMD check.
  <dd>
  <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> NAMESPACE added 
  <dd> Everything exported.

  <dt>
  <li>  T and F instances changed to TRUE and FALSE.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Documentation enhancements and corrections.
  <dd>
      </dl>
</dl>


<h2>0.6-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Added a .args argument to .Perl to allow the caller to specify
      the
      actual argument list.
  <dd>
       This allows the caller to deal directly with the Perl stack a little more easily.

  <dt> Changed the modules.pl script used in the configuration to use
       information from the Config module (Config.pm).
  <dd>

  <dt> Setting <i>PERL_MODULES</i> to <b>no</b> forces no modules to be loaded.
  <dd> This is the same as the command line arguments
       to the <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> command  with
        the arguments  --configure-args='-with-modules=no'.


  <dt> Generate our own xs_init if no Perl modules are used
      (i.e. including R within Perl). 
  <dd>

  <dt> Switched environment variable to PERL5LIB (from PERLLIB) in scripts.
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.5-6</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> --without-modules now works.
  <dd> Thanks to Chris Handorf for pointing out the error that caused
      boot_no to be referenced.
</dl>

<h2>0.5-5</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Test if dTHX is defined and if not provide a pre-processor
      definition for it. 
  <dd> Needed for earlier versions of Perl.
</dl>

<h2>0.5-4</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Configuration corrections for including all converter
       code in the libPerlConverter.so
  <dd>
      
  <dt> Error message about unhandled types in array conversion
       gives the index of the element.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Reset the error stack when we cannot find a routine
       in R_PerlCallModified.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Support for compiling with a threaded installation of Perl.
  <dd> Manifesting itself as compilation errors about missing
       variable <code>my_perl</code>. Pointed out by Steffen Neumann.
</dl>

<h2>0.5-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Removed the deprecated perl_ prefix from the Perl
       API routines. Hopefully this will help compilation
       on systems which currently fail.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> User-level converters
  <dd> See <code>setConverter</code> in Perl and
      <code>addConverter()</code> in R.
  <dt> Garbage collection of the RReferences in Perl.
  <dd>
  <dt> Check for primitives when converting from R to Perl
      includes objects with a dimension and/or class attribute.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.4-0</h2>
<dl>

  <dt> Perl calls which do not "use" the return value
       avoid conversion of the resulting R object.
  <dd> This is checks the GIMME_V value to look for a G_VOID context.

  <dt> Subsetting a Perl array or hashtable with the <code>[</code>
       operator  now returns  a single value when just one index
       is used in specifying the subset. This contrasts with returning
       a list with a single element.
  <dd>
  
  <dt> Handling of NULLs correctly added to different routines.
  <dd>
      
  <dt> Array and hash subsetting works for references also.
  <dd> In particular, this works for (blessed) objects of these types.
      
  <dt> Can pass a reference to an R function as the argument to R::call()
  <dd>
      
  <dt> Passing rferences from R to Perl works properly now.
  <dd>
      
  <dt> Report name of the Perl sub-routine being called when an error occurs.
  <dd>

  <dt> Added RFunctionReferences and RNamedFunctionReferences to
       RReferences module. And extended conversion to export R
       functions using the former.
        Overloading of the invocation mechanism to allow
 <pre>
      $fun = RNamedFunctionReference->new("foo");
      $f->(arg1, arg2,...);
 </pre>
  <dd>
      
  <dt> Can call R from Perl running within an R session, i.e Perl
       callbacks to R, for full bi-directional interface.
  <dd>  
</dl>
